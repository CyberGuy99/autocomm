gate_util: most functions (gate numerics) are used by commute_func, final 3 are used by aggregate function in autocomm.py and merge_func.py. First func is unused

commute_func: 1 function. used in aggregate and schedule function in autocomm.py

merge_func: 3 key functions. 2 helpers. consecutive_merge and linear_merge_iter used by aggregate in autocomm.py. tp_comm_merge_iter used by schedule function in automm.py
    is_comm_block used by assign, schedule and linear_merge_iter
    _is_tp_comm_block is used by tp_comm_merge_iter.

main difference is they stop early (3 DP iters) and check both source/target orders
